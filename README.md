# HenHacks2023
This is the code for the HenHack my group and I made for the project. Were we had 24hrs to complete the prompt lsited below. My contribution was full stack development of the project. Had it linked to my old GitHub so just moving it over.


Welcome! This is our henhacks (https://www.henhackshackathon.com/home) hackathon 2023 project.

The goal of our project was to teach students how to utilize command line tools, including bash commands, git commands & make commands. We accomplished this by creating an interactive GUI and giving tutorials on commands, as well as quizzes.

Installation and use of our program:

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 gui.py
